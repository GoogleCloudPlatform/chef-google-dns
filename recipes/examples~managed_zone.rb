# An example Chef recipe that creates a Google Cloud Computing DNS Managed Zone
# in a project.

# Defines a credential to be used when communicating with Google Cloud
# Platform. The title of this credential is then used as the 'credential'
# parameter in the gdns_project type.
#
# For more information on the gauth_credential parameters and providers please
# refer to its detailed documentation at:
#
# For the sake of this example we set the parameter 'path' to point to the file
# that contains your credential in JSON format. And for convenience this example
# allows a variable named $cred_path to be provided to it. If running from the
# command line you can pass it via the command line:
#
#   CRED_PATH=/path/to/my/cred.json \
#     chef-client -z --runlist \
#       "recipe[gdns::examples~managed_zone]"
#
# For convenience you optionally can add it to your ~/.bash_profile (or the
# respective .profile settings) environment:
#
#   export CRED_PATH=/path/to/my/cred.json
#
# TODO(nelsonjr): Add link to documentation on Supermarket / Github
# ________________________

  # You can also set output-only values as well. Chef will ignore the values
  # when creating the resource, but will assert that its value matches what you
  # specified.
  #
  # This important to ensure that, for example, the top-level registrar is using
  # the correct DNS server names. Although this can cause failures in a run from
  # a clean project, it is useful to ensure that there are no mismatches in the
  # different services.
