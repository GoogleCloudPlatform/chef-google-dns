# The following example requires two environment variables to be set:
#   * CRED_PATH - the path to a JSON service_account file
#   * PROJECT - the name of your GCP project.
#
# For convenience you optionally can add these to your ~/.bash_profile (or the
# respective .profile settings) environment:
#
#   export CRED_PATH=/path/to/my/cred.json
#   export PROJECT=/path/to/my/cred.json
#
# The following command will run this example:
#   CRED_PATH=/path/to/my/cred.json \
#   PROJECT='my-test-project'
#     chef-client -z --runlist \
#       "recipe[gdns::examples~managed_zone]"

  # You can also set output-only values as well. Chef will ignore the values
  # when creating the resource, but will assert that its value matches what you
  # specified.
  #
  # This important to ensure that, for example, the top-level registrar is using
  # the correct DNS server names. Although this can cause failures in a run from
  # a clean project, it is useful to ensure that there are no mismatches in the
  # different services.
